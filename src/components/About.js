        <h2>INSTRUCTOR</h2>
        <p className="instructor">
          I am an open-minded, positive and proactive person. I combine
          directing, coaching pedagogy, and teaching in team sports. After
          obtaining a Sports Science degree from the European University of
          Madrid, I have developed an international career. My coaching vocation
          began as an instructor in the Madrid football federation. This was the
          jump I was looking for, which allowed me to develop my communication
          and technical skills. My first big break came as the Head coordinator
          for Chelsea FC in Madrid, where I was promoted to Technical Director
          after less than a year. In 2007, a position as a Head Coach and
          Coordinator was offered by the prestigious Bar√ßa Academy in Leesburg,
          USA. This position has allowed me to lead a team of coaches and manage
          academy programs, including soccer camps. I returned to Spain in 2017.
          I now dedicate myself to training people personally and according to
          their needs. Not everyone is as fortunate as me to be able to do what
          they love as a career.
